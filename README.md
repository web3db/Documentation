# Web3 Health (Documentation Repo)

This repo is for all the **planning and notes** around the Web3 project at UGA. 

The idea is simple: build an app where people can **sell their health data safely**, with privacy built in, and then grow it later into a bigger data marketplace.  .  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why this repo exists
- Centralized and accessable for **documentation and design discussions.**  
- To keep all our **ideas, notes, and discussions** in one place.  
- To write down the **initial plan, features, and open questions**.  
- To help us stay on the same page as the project grows and easy coordination.

## Working name
**Web3 Health**  
> This is just our **starting name**. We might rename the project later, but for now it works and shows the focus on health + Web3.
