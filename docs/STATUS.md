## üìÖ Last Updated: [2nd Sept]

###  Current Focus
- Starting with **Phase 1: Apple HealthKit + Google Health Connect integration**

- Roles: **User, Buyer, Admin**.  
- Data to start with: fitness, vitals, activity, lifestyle.

## Planned Features (Phase 1: Health-Focused)
- **User Side**  
  - Connect health data from Apple Health and Health Connect.  
  - See a dashboard of earnings and what data is shared. 

- **Buyer Side**  
  - Must go through a verification step.  
  - Can search and request verified health datasets.  
  - Pay through the platform, with privacy checks in place.

- **For the platform/admin**  
  - Take a commission per transaction.  
  - Build trust and transparency tools (still in discussion).  
  - Decide the best storage setup (local vs. cloud vs. Web3).

### ‚ùì Open Questions
- What does **verification** mean for users and buyers.  
- Should buyers have to provide anything?  
- Who sets the price for data (buyer bidding vs. fixed tiers).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns / Risks
- Privacy compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA) not yet mapped.
