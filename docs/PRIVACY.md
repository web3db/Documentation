# Privacy & Compliance

This file tracks privacy, consent, and compliance considerations for the project.
Not much has been decided yet, but these are the early notes and open items.  

---

## 📌 Notes
- ❓ = TBD (needs more discussion)  
- ⚠️ = Concern / Risk  

---

## Principles (**TBD**)
- Users always **control their data**.  
- Consent should be **clear, simple, and revocable**.    
- Data sold must follow **privacy rules and local laws**.  

---

## Early Ideas (**TBD**)
- Add **terms and conditions** step before data sharing.   
- Consider **masking user identity** when selling data.  
- Verified buyers only (reduce risk of data misuse).  

---


##  Next Steps
- Draft a **basic privacy flow** (user consent → approval → sale).   
- Add privacy policies to onboarding flows for both users and buyers.
